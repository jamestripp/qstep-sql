# QSTEP Masterclass: Structured Query Language

This repository contains materials from a QSTEP Masterclass on SQL designed and delivered by [James Tripp](https://www.warwick.ac.uk/jamestripp) on 1st December 2020.

The structure of the day is as follows:

| Time          | Session                                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 9:15  - 10:45 | Introduction. Connecting to a database.    |
| 10:45 - 11:00 | Break                                      |
| 11:00 - 12:30 | Querying databases to address questions    |
| 12:30 - 13:15 | Lunch                                      |
| 13:15 - 14:45 | Databases as analysis platforms            |
| 14:45 - 15:00 | Break                                      |
| 15:00 - 16:30 | Getting out of SQL                         |

The aim of this Masterclass is to provide hands on experience of using SQL to query a database. The data we use are various development indicators of different countries. The content in this repository is ordered in various folders.

| Folder name        | Description                                                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1_preparation      | Details our datasets and gives instructions to set up local databases for this masterclass |
| 2_SQWhat           | A gentle introduction to basic SQL queries and creating databases                          |
| 3_Better_together  | Database functions and operations which aggregate our data                                 |
| 4_Out_of_SQL       | A few simple exercises for exporting and working with the country data                     |

Solutions to the exercises will be provided after the session.

Throughout the content consider what you would like to find out from the dataset. For example, is there a relationship between access to electricity and trade? Or what impact does internet access have on gdp?
